# Review-Processing-and-ID-Mapping
Python code for processing review datasets. It generates unique user IDs, extracts key words (proper nouns, adjectives) from reviews, and assigns tag IDs. The dataset is normalized (case-insensitive, no extra spaces) and saved as a clean CSV file for further analysis or recommendation systems.
